I'm a full-stack software developer who **_loves_** building things, learning new technologies, and <span>pushing my creative limits.</span>

For the past two years, I have had the opportunity to utilize my love for programming by working as a <span>freelance web developer</span>. I built websites for clients using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **WordPress**, and **PHP**. I also analyzed user site traffic and patterns with **Google Analytics** and learned the basics of **SEO**.

While working as a freelance developer, I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at California State University, Fullerton. During my undergrad, I analyzed large datasets using **R** and learned the fundamentals of <span>object oriented programming</span> in **C++**.

After college, I enrolled in an accelerated web development program at LearningFuze. I had the opportunity to be <span>mentored by senior developers</span> and solidify my understanding of many best-practices and important programming concepts.
