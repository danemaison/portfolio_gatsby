I'm a full-stack web developer who loves building things, learning new technologies, and pushing my creative limits.

For the past two years I have had the opportunity to utilize my love for programming by working as a freelance web developer. I built websites for clients using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and PHP. I also analyzed user site traffic and patterns with Google Analytics and learned the basics of SEO.

While working as a freelance developer, I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at California State University, Fullerton. During my undergrad, I analyzed large datasets using R and learned the fundamentals of object oriented programming in C++.

After college, I enrolled in an accelerated web development program at LearningFuze. I had the opportunity to be mentored by senior developers and solidify my understanding of many best-practices and important programming concepts. In the program, I built multiple applications using JavaScript, jQuery, React, PHP, and Node.
